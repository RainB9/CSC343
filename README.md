## Overview of the whole project
In the term project, you will use the skills developed in this course to investigate questions that you are curious about in a domain of interest to you. The project will be done in pairs.
Your project will culminate in a short presentation to course TAs, giving you a chance to develop and practise your presentation skills. To help you stay on track, you will hand in work at several points along the way.
### By the end of this project you should be able to:
> - Investigate a non-trivial, real dataset to determine its precise semantics and choose a subset of the data that is sufficient to answer questions of interest.
> - Use common-sense principles to design a relational schema capable of representing the dataset. This includes identifying alternatives and making trade-offs, and will leave you primed for learning a more principled approach to design later.
> - Implement a relational schema using the SQL Data Definition Language.
> -Clean a real dataset to prepare it for importing into a postgreSQL database.
> - Use the SQL Data Manipulation Language to explore the dataset and answer questions about it.
> - Present technical material to a technical audience.
